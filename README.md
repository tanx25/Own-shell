# Own-shell
Created my own shell called O-shell(osh in short) in C language. Improved upon existing shells(zsh and bash) by
allowing commands (not flags) to be case insensitive. I also improved the 'History' feature to store flags in addition to
commands (current shells do not do this).
Made osh case insensitive and added a new command ( ! N ) that can execute the last Nth command from history
